; These two parameters are for tuning the DBSCAN algorithm

; maximum_relative_edit_distance is a number between 0 and 1 and determines
; the maximum ratio between the Levenshtein edit distance between two strings
; and the length of the longer string. This corresponds to the epsilon
; distance used for DBSCAN
maximum_relative_edit_distance 0.15

; minimum_number_of_neighbors is used to determine whether a data point
; is a core point for cluster formation or not. 
; The query point is counted as 1, so a value of 2 means, one neighbor is
; required
minimum_number_of_neighbors 2

; the algorithm can be set to use only the Hamming distance instead of 
; the Levensthein distance ... increases speed, but is quite strict
use_hamming 				false

; we need some more information about the internals of the algorithm
; for evaluation
get_tree_depth_statistics   true
